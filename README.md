# Make Words
A clone of typing game I came across itch. Using it as an exercise to learn the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework. 

## Project Goal
Get a basic understanding of LÖVE. 

## How To Play
Type a word the starts with the letter on screen and press enter to submit the word. The last letter of the submitted work will be the first letter of the next word. 

Reusing a word will cause player to lose a life. 

Using a invalid words will cause a game over.
